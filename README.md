# Apple Dash
Apple Dash is a simple arcade-style game focused on precision, timing, and quick decision-making. The player controls a basket and must catch 10 apples of a specific color—green, yellow, or red—as they spawn randomly on the branches of a tree and fall toward the ground.

## At a Glance  
Catching the correct apple color rewards the player with +10 points and increases their progress toward the goal. However, mistakes come at a cost:
- Letting a required apple hit the ground results in –10 points
- Catching the wrong apple color results in –5 points

The objective is to successfully collect 10 correct apples while achieving the highest possible score. If the player’s score ever drops below 0, they will fail.
